Aerial vehicle networks are multi-hop ad hoc networks in which nodes are UAVs. To refer tothese networks the term AANET [4] is normally used.
There are two main types of UAVs depending on the vehicle architecture: i) fixed-wing and ii) rotary-wing
Fixed wing UAV  are airplane like vehicles .These vehicles are characterrized for performing conventional takeoff and landing operations like passenger planes.
on the contrary,rotary wings UAVS are able to perform vertical takeoff and landing .
Due to their flying properties,AANETS have the advantage of avoiding most of the obstacles that other terrestrial robots  might find on the ground.
Aquatic vehicle networks (AQNETs) are multi-hop networks that are formed by aquatic nodes.
Differently from the AANETs, aquatic networks are mainly composed of two clearly differentgroups of vehicles, the Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) and the Unmanned Surface vehicles.
Although these vehicles are in condition to operate as standalone, they can cooperate in a work team, in which the tasks are analogous to the hierarchy mentioned in theprevious section.
Regarding the wireless technology used to exchange information, RF (radio frequency)communication is not an option for underwater environments due to the electromagnetic absorption of the aqueous medium.
However, underwater acoustic channels suffer from large propagation delay, limited available bandwidth, and high error probability.
The acoustic signal propagation speed in underwater environments is five orders of magnitude lower than the radio propagation speed ( 3 x 108 m/s vs. 1.5 x 103 m/s), and most acoustic systems operate below 30 kHz.
The frequency band is very narrow, with a maximum reported of 1 MHz at the range of 60 m.
